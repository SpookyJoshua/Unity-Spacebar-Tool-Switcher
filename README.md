# Unity-Spacebar-Tool-Switcher
Press space to change editor tools
This Unity Editor extension allows you to quickly cycle between the Move, Rotate, and Scale tools by pressing the Space key in the Scene View, closely mirroring Unreal Engineâ€™s transform cycling behavior. Once installed, pressing Space will automatically advance from one tool to the next, improving workflow efficiency by eliminating the need to manually switch tools via keyboard shortcuts or toolbar buttons.
